## Project Overview

In the workflow, I noticed my colleagues often need to open Excel repeatedly just to look up values while working in other software.

To make this process smoother, I developed a lightweight local tool that lets users **search an Excel file’s A column from anywhere using a shortcut**, instantly showing the corresponding ABC row.

## Key Features

* **Search Anywhere:** Select text in any software and use a shortcut to find it in Excel.  
* **Quick Results:** Matches display the full row.  
* **Offline & Safe:** Runs locally without sending data outside your computer.  
* **Minimal Interface:** Simple GUI for fast, distraction-free use.
